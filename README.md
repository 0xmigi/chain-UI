Goal is to make a simple UI that is auto personalizes on wallet connection based off of an NFT in your wallet. Kind of an experiment but using Stiches I'm driving the components layout/sizing/spacing and coloring based off of "stuff" in the NFT. 

Next iteration would be to turn it into a frontend library that is connected to a NFT collection. A user could then mint a NFT with their UI "presets" defined and once they log into a site built using this specific frontend library their UI would auto configure to the way they like it. No Dark mode buttons no checking your wallet balances etc... a user can configure the different UI and wallet datas they want to see in the top corner of their web page and then always know it will be there if they are on a site using this hypothetical library. idk i think it be cool  we'll see how far i get
